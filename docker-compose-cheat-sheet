Docker Compose Cheat Sheet

1. docker-compose up - Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service.
   Usage: docker-compose up
   Options: -d (detached), --build (force build), --no-deps (ignore dependencies)

2. docker-compose down - Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by up.
   Usage: docker-compose down
   Options: --volumes (remove data volumes), --rmi (remove images)

3. docker-compose build - Builds or rebuilds services defined in a docker-compose.yml file.
   Usage: docker-compose build
   Options: --no-cache (do not use cache when building), --parallel (build images in parallel)

4. docker-compose logs - View output from containers.
   Usage: docker-compose logs
   Options: -f (follow log output), --tail="all" (number of lines to show from the end of the logs)

5. docker-compose stop - Stops running containers without removing them.
   Usage: docker-compose stop
   Options: service_name (stop one or more specific services)

6. docker-compose start - Starts existing containers for a service.
   Usage: docker-compose start
   Options: service_name (start one or more specific services)

7. docker-compose restart - Restarts all stopped and running services.
   Usage: docker-compose restart
   Options: service_name (restart one or more specific services)

8. docker-compose exec - Execute a command in a running container.
   Usage: docker-compose exec
   Options: -it (interactive), service_name command (e.g., bash)

9. docker-compose rm - Removes stopped service containers.
   Usage: docker-compose rm
   Options: -f (force), service_name (remove one or more specific services)

10. docker-compose pull - Pulls an image associated with a service defined in a docker-compose.yml.
    Usage: docker-compose pull
    Options: --parallel (pull multiple images in parallel)

11. docker-compose push - Pushes images for services to their respective registry/repository.
    Usage: docker-compose push
    Options: service_name (push one or more specific services)

12. docker-compose config - Validates and view the Compose file.
    Usage: docker-compose config

13. docker-compose pause - Pauses running containers of a service.
    Usage: docker-compose pause

14. docker-compose unpause - Unpauses paused containers of a service.
    Usage: docker-compose unpause

Additional Notes:
- File Specification: By default, docker-compose commands look for a docker-compose.yml file in the current directory. Specify an alternate compose file using -f or --file.
- Service Management: Most commands allow you to specify one or more services so you can target specific parts of your setup.
- Environment Variables: Set variables in the shell environment or use an .env file in the same directory as your compose file to influence the project configuration.
