    Usage: docker system prune -a --volumes

Additional Notes
Interactive Mode (-it): When using docker exec or docker run to interact with a shell inside the container, the -it flags are essential for a proper interactive terminal.

Detached Mode (-d): Use this flag with docker run to run the container in the background. This is useful for servers or applications that do not need to interact directly with the user.

Port Mapping (-p): This is crucial when you want to access network services running inside the container from the host machine's network.

Naming Containers (--name): Giving your containers a specific name makes it easier to manage them with other Docker commands.
